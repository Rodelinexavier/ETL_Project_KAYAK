# ETL_Project_Kayak
In this project, I will : 

1.-Scrape data from destinations.

2.-Get weather data from each destination.

3.-Get hotels' info about each destination.

4.-Store all the information above in a data lake.

5.-Extract, transform and load cleaned data from your datalake to a data warehouse.


For that, I will use those websites:

1.- https://nominatim.org/ to get the gps coordinates of all the cities.

2.-  https://openweathermap.org/appid (you have to subscribe to get a free apikey) and https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api to get some information about the weather for the 35 cities and put it in a DataFrame.
